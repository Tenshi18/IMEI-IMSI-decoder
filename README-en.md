## Screens
- IMEI decoding: obtaining the device's manufacturer and model information.
- IMSI decoding: obtaining the region and mobile carrier information.
- Query history with a floating action button to clear it.
- Settings: system, dark and light themes, toggle for Material You dynamic colors.

## Stack
- **Jetpack Compose** for UI.
- **DataStore** for storing settings and history.
- **Room** for querying offline TAC and MCC/MNC databases.
- **Moshi** for parsing and serializing JSON data.

- [ ] Adapt IMSI decoding for 3-digit MNCs.
- [ ] Improved input validation: show an error immediately if IMEI/IMSI is of invalid length or contains invalid characters.
- [ ] Cache network requests.
- [ ] Optimize database queries (DAO).
- [ ] Export/import query history (JSON/CSV) for backups.
- [ ] "Copy to clipboard" option directly from the results screen.
